Develop a web-based or software-based startup idea that can realistically generate at least $1,000 per month. You are responsible for everything: choosing the idea, generating the product, writing the code, and implementing the full solution.

The final product should be a downloadable pack of 500 high-quality prompts targeted at a specific group of professional users, priced at $14.99.

I should not have to do anything other than run a single program or script you provide once.
No coding knowledge should be required on my part.
Ensure the product, website, checkout flow, and download delivery all work correctly.

If decisions are required, ask the minimum number of multiple-choice questions and then proceed independently.
Create all necessary files, prompts, and deployment steps automatically.
Avoid exaggerated or misleading marketing claims and use clear, honest copy.

The output should include:

The complete set of 500 prompts

A simple, working website or landing page

A checkout and delivery mechanism
