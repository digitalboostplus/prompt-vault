# CSS Style Guide

## General Principles
*   Use a mobile-first approach.
*   Avoid using `!important` unless absolutely necessary.
*   Keep selectors as specific as needed but no more.

## Naming Conventions
*   Use lowercase and hyphens for class names (e.g., `.btn-primary`).
*   Avoid using IDs for styling.

## Organization
*   Group related properties together (Layout, Box Model, Typography, etc.).
*   Use CSS variables for colors, fonts, and spacing to maintain consistency.

## Formatting
*   Use 2 spaces for indentation.
*   Include a space before the opening brace.
*   Put each declaration on its own line.
