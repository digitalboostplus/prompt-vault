# Product Guidelines

These guidelines define the communication, design, and structural standards for the Prompt Vault project to ensure a consistent and high-quality user experience.

## Copywriting & Tone
The primary tone for all communications, including the landing page, emails, and the PDF guidebook, is **Approachable & Encouraging**.
*   **Voice:** Friendly, supportive, and empowering.
*   **Goal:** To make advanced AI prompt engineering feel accessible and easy to master for busy professionals, removing the intimidation factor of new technology.
*   **Messaging Focus:** **"The Competitive Edge."** Content should highlight how mastering these AI tools allows users to stay ahead of their peers, work more effectively, and achieve superior results with less effort.

## Visual Identity
The visual theme is **Energetic & Innovative**, designed to reflect the cutting-edge nature of AI technology.
*   **Color Palette:** A dark, sleek background (deep charcoals or blacks) accented with high-saturation, vibrant colors (e.g., electric blue, neon purple, or bright teal) to symbolize "AI energy."
*   **Imagery:** Use modern, high-contrast elements and dynamic layouts that project a sense of forward-thinking innovation while maintaining professional clarity.

## Prompt Presentation Standards
To maintain an approachable feel and ensure immediate utility, every prompt in the collection must adhere to the following presentation standard:
*   **Contextual Scenario:** Each prompt must be accompanied by a brief "When to use this" description. This provides the user with an immediate understanding of the real-world business situation the prompt is designed to solve.

## Information Architecture
To cater to specialized professional roles, all prompts in both the PDF Guidebook and the Web Dashboard will be structured **By Department**.
*   **Primary Categories:** 
    *   Marketing & Communications
    *   Human Resources & People Ops
    *   Operations & Logistics
    *   Finance & Accounting
    *   Strategy & Executive Leadership
    *   Project Management
*   This structure allows users to quickly find the tools most relevant to their specific domain of expertise.
